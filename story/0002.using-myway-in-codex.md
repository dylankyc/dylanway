# Config codex

You can config Codex to use MyWay as a model provider by following these steps.

Open `~/.codex/config.toml` and add the following configuration to use your custom model provider with Codex:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.1"
model_provider = "openai-chat-completions"

[model_providers.openai-chat-completions]
# Name of the provider that will be displayed in the Codex UI.
name = "OpenAI using Chat Completions"
# The path `/chat/completions` will be amended to this URL to make the POST
# request for the chat completions.
base_url = "http://localhost:9999/v1"
# If `env_key` is set, identifies an environment variable that must be set when
# using Codex with this provider. The value of the environment variable must be
# non-empty and will be used in the `Bearer TOKEN` HTTP header for the POST request.
# env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
# Valid values for wire_api are "chat" and "responses". Defaults to "chat" if omitted.
wire_api = "chat"
# If necessary, extra query params that need to be added to the URL.
# See the Azure example below.
query_params = {}

[notice]
hide_gpt5_1_migration_prompt = true
```

Run codex with:

```bash
codex
```
